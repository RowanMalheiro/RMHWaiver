This is the repository for the waiver app for Ottawa's Ronald McDonald House, built by Rowan Malheiro (me :) ).

This repository has both the front end and back end. Front end is in the 'waiver' directory, and backend is in the 'expressapp' directory. First file called in the front end is src/index.js, and first file for the back end is bin/www.

Anyone wishing to deploy this app for themselves will need to set up their own database for authentication, set up and email, and deploy both the front end and back end themselves. I host the front end with firebase hosting and host the backend as a serverless function through react.
